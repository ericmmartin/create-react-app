# react-scripts-enhanced

This fork is solely to enhance the features of [react scripts](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/).

## Creating an App

The only difference from the original [Creating an App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/README.md#creating-an-app) guide is adding `--scripts-version react-scripts-enhanced` to the create-react-app command.

To create a new app, run a single command:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --scripts-version react-scripts-enhanced
```

## Features

* Removed registerServiceWorker.js file and references

The remainder of this file is directly from the CRA repo...
